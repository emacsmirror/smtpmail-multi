;;
;; This library allows you to use different SMTP accounts for sending emails.
;; The SMTP account selected can depend upon the value of the "From" header of the email,
;; or any other header you choose, or even on the results of a predicate function of your choice.

;;; Usage:
;;
;; First you need to add some smtp account details to `smtpmail-multi-accounts' (see the documentation
;; of this variable for more details).
;; Next you may need to set authentication information (usernames and passwords) with `smtpmail-auth-credentials'
;; The `smtpmail-auth-credentials' variable can either be a list of hostname, port, username
;; and password tuples, or the path to an authinfo file containing this information (recommended).
;; For more info on `smtpmail-auth-credentials' see the info page for smtpmail, or view it online
;; here: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/smtpmail/
;; Then you must decide when to use each smtp account and customize `smtpmail-multi-associations'
;; (see the documentation for further details).
;; Finally you must set the values of `send-mail-function' (if you use `mail-mode') and/or
;; `message-send-mail-function' (if you use gnus or `message-mode') to `smtpmail-multi-send-it'.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put smtpmail-multi.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'smtpmail-multi)

;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;
;;  `smtpmail-multi-accounts'
;;    List of SMTP mail accounts.
;;  `smtpmail-multi-associations'
;;    List of rules for associating emails with SMTP accounts in `smtpmail-multi-accounts'.
;;
;; All of the above can customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET smtpmail RET
;;
